## Gateway to Complex Modeling
Neural nets (or neural networks) are computational models patterened after the biological processes of the brain, specifically neurons.

Neural networks allow for the modeling of complex patterns due to its ability to create deep architectures. (*Spoiler: More to come in deep learning talk.*)

Neural networks come in many learning paradigms:
- supervised 
- unsupervised
- reinforcement
